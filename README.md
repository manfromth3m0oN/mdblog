# Easy Markdown Blog

Markdown is parsed in python by [python-markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) 

Code blocks are done with pygments and latex is rendered through mathjax

Site is served by flask which grabs a markdown file and parses it to markdown2 for rendering

A title page is made and md files are listed automatically each page is just md with maybe a header and footer
