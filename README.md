# Easy Markdown Blog

Markdown is parsed in javascript by [marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) 

Site is served by flask which grabs a markdown file and parses it to marked for rendering

A title page is made and md files are listed automatically each page is just md with maybe a header and footer
